```
## Installation of scipy numba in Blender Python console
After opening Blender 3.1 using Powershell load the blend-file provided in the repository. It contains objects used in the addon.
Open the integrated Blender Python console.
```bash
import sys
import subprocess
subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix + '\\bin\\python.exe', '-m', 'ensurepip'])
subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix + '\\bin\\python.exe', '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'numba'])
subprocess.call([sys.exec_prefix + '\\bin\\python.exe', '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'scipy'])
```
If pip is missing (Output 0 in Blender Python console):
```bash
import ensurepip
ensurepip.bootstrap()
from pip._internal import main
main(args=['install','numba'])
main(args=['install','scipy'])
```
## Installation of Blender case with addons
In Blender go to Edit→Preferences→Add-ons:
- Search for looptools and tick the checkbox to install it
- Install ventricle-reconstruction-pipeline.py from repository and tick the checkbox to install it for the current blend-file
- After that a new category should appear on the right side of the 3D Viewport called 'GVR-Pipeline'. Clicking it will open panels containing buttons,etc. used for the pipeline.
# Usage
Video-tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sduwcDeSm8 \
Installation description: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKEKuLW4oYE \
→ Open blend-file provided in the repository and follow the following steps.
## Import ventricle geometries 
File→Import→.STL→ Select all files (Note that the order is important. Order by name from ventricle_0 ... ventricle_x)\
Other file formats are also possible. But some formats e.g. wavefront (.obj) have to be imported individually.
## Setup pipeline
1. Sort volumes\
    1.1. Select all volumes\
    1.2. Click button 'Sort volumes'\
    \
    This restructures the list of selected objects such that the object with the smallest volume is the first object and all objects that were before that object are concatenated in the original order at the end of the object list. It also changes the names of the objects to the naming convention ventricle 0 ... X.
2. Setup ventricle position and rotation\
    2.1. Open panel 'Ventricle position (mm)'\
    2.2. Select only one ventricle and hide the others ('h'-key while selected)\
    2.3. Go into Edit mode\
    2.4. Select a single node centrally in the basal region and press button 'Select basal node' or manually change location of the basal node (before transformation) using the editboxes above the button\
    2.5. Select a single node at the ventricle apex and press button 'Select apex node' or manually change location of the apex node (before transformation) using the editboxes above the button\
    2.6. Select a single node at the ventricle septal ventricle wall and press button 'Select node at septum' or manually change location of the septal ventricle node (before transformation) using the editboxes above the button\
    2.7. Leave Edit mode\
    2.8. Unhide all ventricles and reselect them\
    2.9. Press button 'Translate and rotate'\
    \
    Three points are selected on a ventricle to translate and rotate the ventricles. These transformations of the local ventricle coordinate system to a global coordinate system streamline the handling of the ventricle objects in future steps.
3. Setup valves\
    3.1. Open panel 'Valve options'\
    3.2. Change positition (translation), rotation (angle) and size (radii) of the mitral and aortic valve using the respective textboxes\
    \
    This sets up the arrangement of the mitral and aortic valve. (These inputs can be checked by pressing the buttons 'Add valve interface nodes' and 'Build support structure around valves'. Note that this will add nodes to an existing object. So consider creating a copy before pressing those buttons.)
4. Setup algorithm variables\
    4.1. Open panel 'Algorithm setup variables'\
    4.2. Change variables for the algorithm. Threshold needs to be adjusted depending on geometry. The other settings are advanced and should not be changed lightly.\
    \
    Description variables:
    - Threshold for basal region removal: Cartesian z-coordinate. All vertices above this threshold are deleted during the basal region removal
    - Use mean instead of max volume as reference: Changes the method for finding the reference ventricle to either the max or mean volume (True = Mean volume, False = Max volume)
    - Time RR-duration: Cardiac cycle duration
    - Time diastole: Diastole duration
    - Frames after interpolation: When using approach A5 the ventricle objects are interpolated to this amount of timeframes
    - Depth of poisson surface reconstruction algorithm: Maximum tree depth for Poisson surface reconstruction (https://hhoppe.com/poissonrecon.pdf)
    - Twist during connection algorithm: Value for 'twist'-variable used in the bridge function of the looptools addon used to connect the apical and the basal region. (Usally the default value 0 fits best)
    - Refinement steps for insetting faces: Amount of iterations of insetting faces during the connection algorithm
    - Maximum smoothing iterations: Used in smoothing the connection of basal and apical region. Highest (initial) smoothing value
    - Minimum smoothing iterations: Used in smoothing the connection of basal and apical region. Smallest smoothing value
    - Smoothing repetitions: Used in smoothing the connection of basal and apical region. Amount of smoothing repetitions each with a wider node selection (all neighbours of previous selection are selected)
5. Select approach\
    5.1. In panel 'Geometric ventricle reconstrucion pipeline press button 'Select approach'\
    5.2. In pop-up window choose approach from drop-down menu and confirm with 'OK'\
    \
    Change the valve modeling approach.
## Run pipeline
Select all ventricle objects and either run all steps with the button 'Quick reconstruction' in the panel 'Geometric ventricle reconstruction pipeline' or do the following steps for a more comprehensive execution of the pipeline:
1. Remove basal region\
    1.1. Press button 'Remove basal region' in the panel 'Geometric ventricle reconstruction pipeline'\
    \
    This removes all vertices above the z-value for a reference ventricle. The vertices of the other ventricle object with identical indices to the deleted one in the reference are also deleted. The upper edge loop is smoothed such that all its vertices lay on the same xy-plane. Lastly the ventricle objects are shifted along the z-axis such that all xy-planes match with the reference ventricle xy-plane.
2. Create basal region\
    2.1. Press button 'Create basal region' in the panel 'Geometric ventricle reconstruction pipeline'\
    \
    This creates a reference basal region used for all ventricle objects. For that first the valve indices and a support structure are added to a copy of the reference ventricle. Then the Poisson surface reconstruction is applied to the vertices to create a surface object from all vertices. After that the object is remeshed and the apical region is removed while smoothing the lower edge loop of the resulting basal region.
3. Connect basal and apical parts\
    3.1. Press button 'Connect basal and apical regions' in the panel 'Geometric ventricle reconstruction pipeline'\
    \
    This creates a copy of the reference basal region for all apical region ventricle objects and connects them with the looptools_bridge function from the Blender addon Looptools. Since this connection creates long quadrangular faces, the faces need to be split using an integrated insetting algorithm leading to faces where the deviation of edge lengths are reduced. After that the faces are triangulated and iteratively smoothed. These processes are done for the reference ventricle object first and then copied to the other ventricles to remain node-connectivity.
4. Add atrium, aorta and valves\
    4.1. Press button 'Add atrium, aorta and valves' in the panel 'Geometric ventricle reconstruction pipeline'\
    \
    This copies objects for aorta, atrium, mitral and aortic valve found in the Blender-project and scales, rotates and positions them at their respective places.

## Optional usage: Development tools panel
### Compute volumes
Compute volumes of all selected objects and prints them to the Blender Python console.
### Get vertex indices
Print indices and their position vectors of all selected vertices.
### Get edge index
While exactly two neighbouring vertices are selected print the vertex indices and the edge index.
### Node-connectivity check
Check the node-connectivity of all selected objects. This includes:
- a check if there are any nodes with only two neighbouring vertices (this would lead to bad triangle face generation when exporting from blender)
- a check if the amount of vertices, edges and faces match
- a check if the edges and faces of all objects are created with the same vertices
### Color minimal distance to raw object
During the usage of the pipeline the longitudinal shift is saved as a variable bound to the respective object (ventricle 0 ... X). The user has to re-import the raw data and rename it to 'ref_obj'. While the reconstructed object is selected pressing the button 'Color minimal distance to raw object' will compute the minimal distance from each face-center of the reconstructed ventricle to any face-center of the reference object resulting in a 3d-representation of the Hausdorff distance (https://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/teaching/cg-projects/98/normand/main.html). The faces of the object are then colored with the distances which are normalized with the maximum value resulting in a scale from 0 to 1 (blue→white→red). To view the colors select 'Material Preview' in Blender (top right in 3D Viewport). This process give a qualitative visual representation of the quality of the reconstruction pipeline.
